E-Commerce with .Net Core &amp; Onion Architecture

# what is the onion architecture?

The Onion architecture is a form of layered architecture and we can visualize these layers as concentric circles. Hence the name Onion architecture.

There are multiple ways that we can split the onion, but we are going to choose the following approach where we are going to split the architecture into 4 layers:

* Domain Layer
* Service Layer
* Infrastructure Layer
* Presentation Layer

Conceptually, we can consider that the Infrastructure and Presentation layers are on the same level of the hierarchy.

# Project Explanation

In this project, i am going to build an (simple) e-commerce app. Product - User - Category tables are going to be implemented. Not order or shipping etc :)

The goal is developing clean, maintainable & testable architecture!

# What will we use?

* .Net 6.0 (.Net Core)
* Onion Architecture
* Entity Framework Core
* Bogus (Fake Data Generation)
* AutoMapper
* MsSQL 
* Blazor for Web
* Generic Repository Pattern
* Swagger
* RabbitMQ
* Mediatr & CQRS for .net core

This is going to be great! Keep in touch. I am going to update repo often. Thanks for reading. Have a great day!
